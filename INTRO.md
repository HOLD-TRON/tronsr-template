## HOLDTRON 

* Is any investor that has one or more shares of cryptocurrency in the TRON network, and which also aims to maintain its medium and long term position, avoiding FUD, bad news, speculations of supposed traders or denominated geniuses of the cryptomoneda that have enough followers in telegram or twitter etc.

* As we know a lot about ourselves, we are small or big investors that are towards big projects such as the foundation of tron ​​that just started the new era of the decentralized web

* We emphasize knowing that many of us are not interested in the price of tomorrow or the price of today. Because we would practically be playing roulette russa, that is to say that we have entered into a position where more strength and value should have each investor because at this moment the btc is unstable due to the great speculation of the prices provoked by multi-million dollar companies and others called * WHALES OF THE CRYPTOS *

* Being housed in groups of traders or communities where speculated prices are called * Pumps or Landfills * affects small capital investors because being surrounded by news or speculation only has to leave tron ​​for fear of losing more% of their capital.

* As an investor experience of crypto I have been in serious setbacks due to bad news problems causing me to lose a lot of my capital in those times. As time went by, I began to dominate the crypto issue and nowadays we are in a market where the news sends more than supply and demand.

* For this reason we invite you to be part of our community of investors in the medium and long term, we will be hand in hand with each member whether major or minor investor at your disposal to inform large and future projects of the foundation of tron ​​and also granting small incentives of TRON coins to the participants of different projects, games and people who collaborate with our community either by sending news of last moment or by recommending our SR HOLDTRON.
